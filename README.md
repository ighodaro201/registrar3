Osita Ighodaro and Ben Musoke-Lubega Assignment 3

I (Osita) worked on creating the modularised files to be used. I
created a CourseBasic object, which stores all the information on
a course that would be shown in the primary page. I also created a
CourseInfo object that stores all the information on a course that
would be stored on the secondary page that shows detailed info.
I also created Database.java which handles all the database methods,
such as connecting and disconnecting to the database, and searching
the database to retrieve the courses and coursedetails needed.

I (Ben) primarly worked on our Reg.java program which utilized the Spark 
library to serve as our server.

We did not receive any help

We spent roughly 15 hours doing this assignment

It helped with my confidence in coding generally, and helped me further
understand bash scripts. It also helped me see more clearly how to 
modularise.
